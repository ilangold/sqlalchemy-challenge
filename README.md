## Hawaii Climate App
Module 10 Challenge

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (climate_starter.ipynb) which connects to a SQLite database and runs analysis on Hawaii temperature station measurements and provides visualizations of the analyzed data.

There is a python Flask app (app.py) which reads in the data from the SQLite database and returns JSON data for several of the elements in the database.
